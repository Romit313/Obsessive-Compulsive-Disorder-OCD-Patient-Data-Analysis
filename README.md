# Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Patient Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 1,500 OCD patients to provide actionable insights for OCD treatment decisions. The analysis was done using SQL for data manipulation and feature engineering, enhancing data quality for better insights. Interactive dashboards were created using Power BI to visualize clinical and demographic data, offering a clear understanding of patterns and trends in the dataset.
